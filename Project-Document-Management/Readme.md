# Project 

In this project we are going to be working with zip files, images and the files system.
We are going to download a zip containing png images. In the zip file, there two pairs of images, a main image and an thumbnail version prefixed with an underscore(e.g _2384.png).


## Milestones

- [x] Download the zip file
- [x] Unzip the zip file containing the images in a temporary store(cache)
- [x] Display the thumbnail version of the images in a list
- [x] When a thumbnail is tapped, present a detail view controller with the original image displayed
